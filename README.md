# Senior Programming Final - 2024

The code for my senior programming final practical exam.
This contains the necessary parts and some extras,
like text formatting with ANSI escape codes,
and a visual representation for the cards after you've guessed.

## Teacher supplied requirements document

Design: a program that plays a card game of higher or lower

* Play a game of cards
* Is the card I choose going to be higher or lower than the card that the computer picks
* At the end of every round ask if they want to play again or game ends when there are no more cards
* When the game is over list how many games the user won and lost
* A deck of cards has 52 cards with 4 suits of 13 cards each
* Where Ace is considered high
* Once a card is played it cannot be played again
* The act of checking which card is higher should be a **function**
* The act of setting up the deck should be a **function**

## List of requirements not in the document

* Aces are high (value of 14)
* Print out the user's card before the user guesses
* Ties don't effect score, but should print them out
